# Homelab-docker
my homelab docker-compose files

## Quick Start

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:

1. Define your app's environment with a ``Dockerfile`` so it can be reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in ``docker-compose.yml`` so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run ``docker compose up`` and Compose will start and run your entire app
